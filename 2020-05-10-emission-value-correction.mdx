## Correct wet-basis concentrations to dry-basis concentrations

$$ c*d = \frac{c_w}{1-m*{Flue Gas}} $$

where

- $$c_d$$ = dry-basis concentration value (ppm or percent)
- $$c_w$$ = wet-basis concentration value (ppm or percent)
- $$ m\_{Flue Gas}$$ = moisture fraction of the flue gas

To correct a concentration value for dilution, emissions can be expressed in three ways; with reference to a specified CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, or excess air value.

## CO<sub>2</sub> correction (Corrected to 12% CO<sub>2</sub>)

$$ c*{d(12\% CO_2)} = c_w \times \frac{12}{\%CO*{2w}} =c*d \times \frac{12}{\%CO*{2d}} $$

The concentration can be determined using either a wet-basis or a dry-basis concentration value as long as the emissions and CO<sub>2</sub> are both measured on a wet basis or on a dry basis.

## O<sub>2</sub>(6% O<sub>2</sub>)

$$ c*{d(6\% O_2)} = c_d \times \frac{20.9 - 6.0}{20.9 - \%O*{2d}} $$

## Excess Air Correction

Excess Air (EA) corrects to 50%.

$$ c\_{d(50\% EA)} = c_d \times \frac{100+\%EA}{150} $$

$$ \%EA = \frac{\%O_2 - 0.5\%CO}{0.266\%N_2 - \%O_2 + 0.5\%CO} $$

CO% is usually negligible, this calculation requires a dry O<sub>2</sub> measurement or a wet O<sub>2</sub> measurement
