# Welcome to My MDX Blog

Hello, world! This is my first blog post using MDX. MDX allows you to seamlessly integrate JSX (React components) with Markdown.

## Markdown Features

MDX supports all the standard Markdown features, such as:

- Lists
- Headings
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks

Here's an example of a code block:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello, MDX!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
