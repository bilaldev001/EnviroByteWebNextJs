              The nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) has significant adverse
              environmental and health effects, contributing to acid rain and
              smog and forming fine particles (PM) and ozone in the ambient air
              (tropospheric ozone or ground-level ozone). Industrial facilities
              with large stationary combustion sources are typically required to
              be equipped with one or more continuous emissions monitoring
              systems (CEMSs) to monitor NO<sub>x</sub> emissions for compliance
              with regulatory emission limits. Due to the high CEMSs operating
              costs and frequent maintenance, there is an alternative for
              monitoring NO<sub>x</sub>, a predictive emissions monitoring
              system (PEMS).

              EnviroByte works closely with Minxing Si to provide predictive
              emissions and analytics. Minxing Si was the first to introduce
              open-source machine learning libraries for PEMS development and
              conducted extensive research on machine learning for environmental
              monitoring.

              PEMS is used for environmental monitoring worldwide, the major
              regulatory frameworks for PEMS were developed by the United States
              Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the European Union.
              Many countries outside of the US and Europe have adopted these
              standards, especially the US EPAâ€™s PEMS certification standards.
              The main US federal regulation that accepts PEMS as an emission
              monitoring and reporting tool is Title 40 of the Code of Federal
              Regulations (CFR 40), Part 60, 61, 63, and 75.

              In Canada, PEMS is an accepted alternative monitoring method to
              CEMS at federal and provincial levels. For example, Alberta 2021
              CEMS code outlines the requirements of PEMS.
