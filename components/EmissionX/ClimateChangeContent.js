						<h3>Climate Change Adaptation</h3>
						<p>
							Adaptation involves changing human and natural systems to respond to the future impacts of
							climate change. In other words, adaptation is an attempt to address the effects of a problem.
						</p>

						<p>
							We begin by raising awareness of the need for climate adaptation. Preliminary climate change
							vulnerability or risk assessments are the first step for your organization.  We will then
							discuss your organization and its context, which will lead to setting achievable goals
							that work for both your business and the environment together and can be maintained. In
							addition to developing climate change adaptation plans for your organizations, emergency
							preparedness and response plans can be enhanced to address anticipated climate change
							impacts. Also, we offer effective and detailed training on these actions for a smooth
							transition to a more climate-conscious business.
						</p>
						<h3>Climate Change Mitigation</h3>
						<p>
							Mitigation strategy is one that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to
							climate change. In other words, mitigation helps to address the cause of the problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our climate change mitigation services help clients by working on emissions reduction
							opportunities. We assist clients in converting well-thought-out solutions into practical
							implementation. We are providing GHG quantification and reporting on behalf of clients,
							according to state-of-the-art, jurisdictional, and other requirements, such as ISO standards,
							government programmes such as the GHG Mitigation Assessment process that adheres to the
							Climate Lens Assessment Guidelines that Infrastructure Canada developed in 2019 and 2020,
							or even voluntary programs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our GHG offset project development and benefits analysis help to monetize efforts to
							mitigate GHG emissions. With third-party validation, verification, and agreed-upon services
							for reporting and offset projects, as well as training on a broad range of climate mitigation
							actions, we can ensure a smooth transition from thinking about sustainability to really
							making a difference.
						</p>
						<h3>Climate change risk assessment</h3>
						<p>
							Climate risk assessments identify the likelihood of future climate hazards and their
							potential impacts on cities and their communities. This is fundamental for informing the
							prioritization of climate action and investment in adaptation.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can assist clients in conducting climate change risk assessments that adhere to
							international standards such as ISO 14090:2019 Adaptation to Climate Change: Principles,
							Requirements, and Guidelines or ISO 14091:2021 Adaptation to Climate Change: Guidelines on
							Vulnerability, Impacts, and Risk Assessment. Additionally, we can help organizations with
							climate change resilience assessments that follow the guidelines for Climate Lens Assessments
							that Infrastructure Canada developed in 2019 and 2020. These risk and resilience assessments
							are the foundation for planning and implementing climate change adaptation.
						</p>

						<h3>Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures</h3>
						<p>
							Disclosure is the keyword of the 2020s. The Financial Stability Board established the
							Task-Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. With guidance from over 30 business
							leaders, TCFD provides a framework on how to disclose climate change information under the
							headings of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. We specialize
							in the physical and transitional risk assessment and management processes for your business
							and throughout your value chain.
						</p>
						<p>
							TCFD has led Securities Commissions around the world to plan for and implement mandatory
							disclosure programs. The US government, the worldâ€™s largest procurer of goods and services,
							will soon require all suppliers selling more than $7.5 million annually to disclose their
							GHG emissions.
